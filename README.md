## Font
I use a modded version of Operator Mono that I call Operator Code. To get the same:

1. Purchase the ScreenSmart version of Operator Mono
- Why Operator Mono? I find it very easy to read, even at small sizes, its italics are great, and it's part of a useful family for other kinds of work, say, as a Sans serif for blog posts. I can't lie though, I've used Input Mono and FiraCode quite a bit.
- Why ScreenSmart? It's meant for rendering screen sizes, unlike Multipurpose and Office which are tuned differently.
- Why pay? Because creating good fonts is hard and takes a long time. If you're here you're somebody who appreciates the work that goes into making something both functional and beautiful. You could always just use an open source font instead. Fira Code is [already patched this way](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode).

2. [Ligaturize](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) in the dev ligatures. You'll need font-forge for these mods (see the Ligaturizer README)

3. Download and apply the [Nerd Font patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-8-patch-your-own-font) to get many snazzy icons in your editor.

4. Make sure ligatures are turned on in your editor/terminal emulator
